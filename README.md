## Description
A simple password generator built with JavaScript. 

This web application provides the ability to create a secure password by simply selecting the necessary length and character types.

Creating the functionality of this password generator was a very stimulating and rewarding experience, and feel it helped me further my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript concepts such as array methods, for loops and conditionals.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
![Screenshot of what the application looks like on desktop](./images/screenshotOne.png)

When clicking on 'Generate Password', a pop-up window will appear, prompting the user to input the preferred password length, between 8 and 128 characters.

Then, the user will have to click 'OK' for each type of character they need to have included in the password, choosing among lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. 

In the case that the password length is invalid, or that the user doesn't select any type of characters, an alert will appear, and the process will start from scratch.

The application can also be accessed via mobile.

## Credits
Overall instruction and provision of necessary materials for this project from the EdX Front-End Web Development Bootcamp instructor and teaching assistants (Oct2023 Cohort). 

Special thanks to my EdX academic tutor Sandra Smith for her support in helping me understand the concepts I needed to implement in this project.

Additionally, a few resources and tutorials were very helpful in guiding me towards the completion of this task and learning JavaScript overall:
- On JavaScript window prompt(): https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp
- On JavaScript window confirm(): https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp
